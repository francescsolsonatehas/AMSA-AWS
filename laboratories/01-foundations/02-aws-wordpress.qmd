## 1. Creating a Data Base (DB) with RDS

AWS' relational database service (RDS) is a very interesting option for deploying MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Aurora databases. This service offers easy and efficient database management, as well as the ability to perform backups, scalability, and high availability.

1. Let's go to the console of **Amazon RDS**.

2. In the **Amazon RDS** console, click on **Create database**

    * Select mode **Standard Create**
    * Select data base engine **MySQL**
    * Select the data base version **MySQL 8.0.42**
    * Select the template **Sandbox**
    * Name of the database **wordpress**
    * Master username **admin**
    * Credential management: **self-managed**
    * Select **set a password**

    Save the password. Leave the rest of the parameters as default. Once finished, click **Create database**.


3. Wait a few minutes until the column **Status** turns green and says **Available**. 

4. Once the database is available, click on the database and go to the tab **Connectivity & security** to view the connection details.

    * Hostname: `database-1.cik8jidkherq.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
    * Port: `3306`
    * Username: `admin`
    * Database name: `wordpress`


5. Add a rule to the **Security Group** of the database to allow connections from the EC2 instance.

	5.1. Go to the console of **Amazon RDS**
	
	5.2. Select our database instance
	
	5.3.In the section **Connectivity & security**, search for the **Security Group** associated with the database
	
	5.4. Click on the **Security Group** to edit the rules (similar to *default sg-0efc4051ab6288a2d*)
	
	5.5. Add a new inbound rule to allow connections from the IP address of our EC2 instance. Select the connection type **MySQL/Aurora** and enter the IP address of the EC2 instance. To do this, you need to click on **Edit inbound rules** and then add the following rule:

	  ```plaintext
    		Type: MySQL/Aurora
    		Protocol: TCP
    		Port Range: 3306
    		Source: Custom
    		Seleccionar el grup de seguretat de la instància EC2 (launch-wizard-1)
  	```


6. To test the connection, we need a MySQL client. The easiest way is to create an EC2 instance and install the MySQL client.
  
  - Create an EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2023 (just like in the previous lab)
  - Connect to the EC2 instance via SSH
  - Install the MySQL client:

    ```bash
    # Buscar el paquet a instal·lar
    dnf search mysql
    # Instal·lem el client mariadb
    sudo dnf install mariadb105 -y
    ```

 6. Connect to the RDS database from the EC2 instance:

    ```bash
    mysql -h hostname -u admin -p
    # Introdueix la contrassenya quan et demani
    ```

7. Create the database **wordpress** and user **wordpress** with all permissions

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
    CREATE USER 'wordpress'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'wordpress';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpress'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    exit
    ```
8. We already have the database ready for the WordPress installation

## 2.  Installing WordPress on the EC2 instance

1. To install WordPress, a web server must be installed first (Apache):

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install httpd -y
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    ```

::: {.callout-tip title="Nota"}
Note that the start command *start* the Apache service, but it does not make it start automatically when the machine is rebooted. Therefore, we also need to run the *enable* command
:::

2. By default, the security group of the EC2 instance does not allow HTTP connections (port 80). You can verify this by trying to access the public IP address of the EC2 instance from a web browser. You will see that it cannot connect.

::: {.callout-tip title="Note"}
If you click the link to the public IP address, it will try to access via HTTPS, but since we don't have an SSL certificate, it won't work. Manually modify the URL to http://<public_ip_addres>
:::
   
3. We need to add an inbound rule to the security group to allow HTTP connections:

    - Go to the console of '**EC2**
    - Select our EC2 instance
    - In the section of **Security**, "click on the **Security Group** associated with the instance (launch-wizard-1).
    - Add a new inbound rule to allow HTTP connections:

    ```plaintext
    Type: HTTP
    Protocol: TCP
    Port Range: 80
    Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
    ```

::: {.callout-tip title="Note"}
This rule will allow HTTP connections from anywhere
:::

4. Once the rule has been added, we can access the public IP address of the EC2 instance from the web browser. We should see Apache's default page

5. A requirement for WordPress is to have PHP installed. Let's install PHP and the necessary extensions:

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install php8.1 -y
    sudo dnf install php-curl php-zip php-gd php-soap php-intl php-mysqlnd php-pdo -y
    ```

6. Restart the Apache service to load the PHP extensions:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```

7. Now we can install WordPress. First, we download the latest version of WordPress and save it to Apache's default directory:

    ```bash
    cd /tmp
    wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf latest.tar.gz
    sudo mv wordpress/* /var/www/html/
    sudo rm -rf wordpress latest.tar.gz
    sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/
    ```

8. Access the public IP address of the EC2 instance from your web browser. You should see the WordPress installation page

9. Follow the steps of the WordPress installation:

    - Select the language (*català*).
    - Click on **Continua**
    - Click on **Som-hi!**
    - Enter the database connection details:
      - Database Name: `wordpress`
      - Username: `wordpress` (previously created user)
      - Password: `wordpress` (password created earlier)
      - Database Host: the RDS database endpoint (for example: `database-1.cik8jidkherq.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`)
      - Table Prefix: `wp_` (default)
    - Click on **Envia**
    - If everything is correct, click on **Executa la instal·lació**
    - Enter the site title (**AMSA Lab02**), el nom d'usuari (**francesc**), the password (**9T3nEBqnFqDW3uhc7S**) and the email (**francesc.solsona@udl.cat**)
    - Click on **Instal·la WordPress**
    - Once the installation is complete, click on **Inicia sessió** and enter the credentials you created

## 3. Cleanup

Once completed, you can delete all EC2 instances and the RDS database to avoid unnecessary charges to your AWS account.
